Collaborating in a team of 4 to realize a detailed Simulink model of the ’Ingenuity’ helicopter flying in the Martian atmosphere. Ingenuity was a drone helicopter that operated from 2021 to 2024 on Mars as part of NASA’s Mars 2020 mission. We built a high-fidelity Mars-flight model of Ingenuity and tested two control strategies: static feedback-linearization and backstepping. Backstepping won the shoot-out, harnessing the helicopter’s under-actuation to nail trajectory tracking in the thin Martian atmosphere.
