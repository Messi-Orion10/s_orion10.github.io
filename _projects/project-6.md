My thesis develops and rigorously analyses a **geometric control law for a broad family of multi-rotor aerial vehicles** equipped 
with at least 4 propellers arbitrarily placed about the centre of mass and allowed to tilt by two angles.  
These platforms are **fully actuated in orientation** and possess at least one direction along which it is possible to independently 
regulate the control force without disturbing attitude.  A subset also experiences a **parasitic force**: 
any torque commanded for re-orientation injects an unwanted translational force.  
Building on a strategy proposed by **Prof. Antonio Franchi**, I prove the controller achieves **local exponential stability** 
despite this coupling, unifying attitude and position control for both ideal and parasitic-force vehicles in a 
single theoretical framework.
