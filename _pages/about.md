# Welcome!

Iâ€™m a **27-year-old Control Systems Engineer** with a deep background in control theory, robotics, computer science, and software development.  
Curiosity drives me: I love tackling complex problems that sit at the intersection of **mathematics, physics, and engineering**â€”whether that means designing a geometric controller for a VTOL drone or optimizing real-time software on an embedded board.

## Professional snapshot

- **Core expertise:** nonlinear & geometric control, state estimation, robotics, embedded C/C++, Python, ROS 2, MATLAB/Simulink  
- **Recent projects:**  
  - *VTOL tricopter*: geometric tracking controller and transition management (Sapienza Flight Team)  
  - *Autonomous rover*: LQR-based path tracking and SLAM integration  
  - *Spacecraft attitude demo*: quaternion-based control with reaction wheels, tested in Hardware-in-the-Loop  
- **Toolbox I reach for:** Git & GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Docker, Linux RT, LaTeX

## Research & learning

Iâ€™m passionate about pushing the boundaries of **artificial intelligence applied to control systems**â€”from learning-based MPC to safe reinforcement learning for robotics. I regularly dive into preprints, implement papers, and share my findings via blog posts and conference talks.

At the moment Iâ€™m exploring:  

1. **Adaptive MPC** for agile aerial vehicles  
2. **Graph neural networks** for multi-robot coordination  
3. **Formal verification** of safety-critical real-time code

## Beyond engineering

Outside of the lab and code editor youâ€™ll likely catch me:

- ðŸŽ¸ **Playing guitar** â€“ jamming blues riffs or arranging acoustic covers  
- âš½ **Enjoying sports** â€“ five-a-side football, trail running, or a pick-up basketball game  
- â™Ÿ **Analyzing chess puzzles** â€“ trying to improve my rapid rating on Lichess  

These hobbies keep me balanced, sharpen strategic thinking, and fuel creativity.
