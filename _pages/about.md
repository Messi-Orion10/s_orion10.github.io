# Welcome!

I‚Äôm a **27-year-old Control Systems Engineer** with a deep background in control theory, robotics, computer science, and software development.  
Curiosity drives me: I love tackling complex problems that sit at the intersection of **mathematics, physics, and engineering**‚Äîwhether that means designing a geometric controller for a VTOL drone or optimizing real-time software on an embedded board.

## Professional snapshot

- **Core expertise:** nonlinear & geometric control, state estimation, robotics, embedded C/C++, Python, ROS 2, MATLAB/Simulink  
- **Recent projects:**  
  - *VTOL tricopter*: geometric tracking controller and transition management (Sapienza Flight Team)  
  - *Ingenuity-style Mars helicopter*: high-fidelity Simulink model of NASA‚Äôs **Ingenuity** for Martian-atmosphere flight-dynamics analysis  
  - *Car Racing AI*: end-to-end CNN policy for OpenAI Car Racing‚Äîdata collection, network training, deployment  
  - *Under-actuated robot via DDP*: differential dynamic programming on pendubot & acrobot with hard torque limits  
- **Toolbox I reach for:** Git & GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Docker, Linux RT, LaTeX

## Research & learning

I‚Äôm passionate about **control theory in all its flavors**: from rigorous, model-based design to modern approaches that leverage machine learning and reinforcement learning.  
Right now my main focus is on **non-linear control of non-differentially-flat under-actuated rigid bodies with coupled moment‚Äìforce dynamics**‚Äîthe core topic of my master‚Äôs thesis.

My workflow is research-driven: I first dig deep into the underlying theory, then translate insights into working prototypes in **MATLAB/Simulink**, documenting each project with comprehensive PDF reports.

## Beyond engineering

Outside of the lab and code editor you‚Äôll likely catch me:

- üé∏ **Playing guitar** ‚Äì arranging acoustic covers  
- ‚öΩ **Enjoying sports** ‚Äì football fan and sports fan in general  
- ‚ôü **Analyzing chess puzzles** ‚Äì trying to improve my rapid rating on chess.com
- ü™ê **Exploring astrophysics** ‚Äì satisfying my curiosity with popular-science books and following the latest discoveries on social media  
- üåê **Staying social** ‚Äì actively sharing projects and insights on LinkedIn, GitHub, and tech communities, always eager to connect and exchange ideas
- 
These hobbies keep me balanced, sharpen strategic thinking, and fuel creativity.
